ebay_scrobbler
==============

This is a quick and (very) dirty python script which looks for a keyword (in some physical place) in the Italian version of Ebay Classified (Ebay Annunci). It has memory of the most recent one, and if something new appears, will send you an email with some infomation about the new stuff. It requires a gmail account to send the mail (it's tweakable to use any SMTP server, of course)
